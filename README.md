# My fastAPI

This project was devloped for the purpose of leaning about API functionality and relational database management.

My previous knowledge included using raw SQL and database schema, so this project was a great introduction to using fucntional technologies around these concepts. The fast API framework was leveraged for its seamless handling of HTTP requests and responses as well as its user-friendly documentation.

Model schema were specified using pydanitc. Queries were initiallly implemented using raw SQL and cursor operations but were later mingrated into SQLAlchemy. Database operations were managed through Postgres and PGAdmin, which allow for easy scaling and efficient querying. Developmental testing was done through Postman. 

One of the goals of this project was to implement CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). These were the core functionalities developed for the API alongside user account creation.

Technologies:
- Uvicorn
- PostgreSQL
- PGAdmin 4
- Postman
- SQLAlchemy

## Future Work
- Automated testing
- Integration of OAuth user authentication
- Full development into platform clone (ex. Twitter clone, Reddit clone)
